### Week 1 Achievements:
* Understanding each other members.
* Gathering basic knowledges for this project:
  * What tropical cyclones (hurricanes/typhoons) are and how they’re structured (eye, eyewall, rainbands).
  * How they form in nature: warm SSTs (~26–27 °C+), moisture, pre-existing disturbance, Coriolis, and low vertical wind shear.
  * Energy source & lifecycle: latent-heat release, intensification, peak, decay/extratropical transition.




* Understanding AWS service groups:
  * Compute — EC2, Lambda, ECS/EKS
  * Storage — S3, EBS, EFS
  * Networking & CDN — VPC, Route 53, CloudFront

* Key concepts learned of AWS service:
  * Regions, Availability Zones, and global services.
  * IAM users, roles, and least privilege.
  * VPC design, routing, and security groups.
  * Cost allocation with tags and budgets
