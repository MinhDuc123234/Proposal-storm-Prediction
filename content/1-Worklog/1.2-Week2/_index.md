### Week 2 Achievements:

* Gained deeper understanding of AWS fundamentals

* SWorked with Amazon S3 and EC2 services:
  * Created and managed S3 buckets for storm data
  * Launched EC2 instances and configured security groups
  * Generated and used key pairs for secure accessView EC2 service
  * Connected via SSH and set up the working environment
  * Linked S3 with EC2 for data workflow integration


* Progress on Storm Modeling Project
  * Explored different modeling approaches and how they can be applied to the project data
  * Reviewed academic research to identify formulas and methods relevant
  * Defined key metrics (speed, heading, distance, lifetime) and clarified how they will be derived from raw data.

* Coordinated with the Software Engineering team:
  * Defined integration points between model and software
  * Clarified responsibilities of each side
